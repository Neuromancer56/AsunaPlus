# [goblins] Goblins (Mobs Redo addon) [mod] for Minetest Game and MineClone 2

This mod adds several Goblins (and Goblin Dogs) to Minetest that will spawn near ore deposits or lairs underground.

## Features

* Compatible with both Minetest Game and [MineClone 2](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/)!
* Some Goblins have loot filled chests nearby! Can you befriend or defeat these goblins?
* Goblins dig caves, destroy torches, create lairs, set traps, cultivate mushrooms and some are aggressive.
* Gobdogs will roam caves, bury bones and other items in soft terrain, eat meats. Some Gobdogs are aggressive!
* Basic trading with Goblins - the more you trade with a goblin, the more likely you will get things in return! 
* Goblins have a territorial framework for location based interactions, if you trade with more Goblins of a territory
  your trades will be easier! 
* Harming goblins will negatively affect your trade with all gobins in a territory!  
* If you brandish weapons (including axes) around a goblin it may decide to attack!
* Goblins and Gobdogs will defend each other.  You can have them defend other mobs by simply
adding to: 
`on_spawn = function(self)`
the following:
`self.groups = {"goblin_friend", "gobdog_friend"}`
in your own mobs definition!
* There are many settings now accessible from the minetest menu -> "settings" tab -> "all settings" -> "mods" -> "goblins" list!
these can also be defined in the settingtypes.txt
* Goblin and Gobdog spawning is now configured from goblins_spawning.lua (at least until there is a way to easily change these with the setting menu :P )
* Goblin related follow and drop items now moved to mod_storage
* Goblin spawning parameters moved to mod_storage
* A basic and optional (enabled in minetest setting menu) HUD is available
* tested with Minetest 5.4 and 5.70(dev)
